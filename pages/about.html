      <p>     I am Hakeem Lingo, a 3rd year student studying Computational Media at Georgia Tech. My program knowledge includes powerful Adobe softwares, namely Photoshop, After Effects, Premiere Pro and Illustrator, and I am a beginner in Blender.<br>
          
          I'm completely self taught in these programs, if you exclude the hundreds of hours of YouTube tutorials and online resources of course. I began editing on Sony Vegas Pro in 2018 and in 2020 I decided to make the switch to Adobe programs.<br>
        
          I'm very excited for us to blend your vision along with my blessing touches to create stellar work. </p>
